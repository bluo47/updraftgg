# My React Node App

This project is a full-stack application built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, integrated with a PostgreSQL database.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React and TypeScript. It includes various components and routing to create a dynamic user interface.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `App.tsx`: The main application component.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `types/`: TypeScript interfaces for props and state.

## Backend

The backend is built using Node.js with Express and TypeScript, and it connects to a PostgreSQL database.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the backend application.
  - `app.ts`: Entry point of the backend application.
  - `controllers/`: Contains controllers for handling API requests.
  - `routes/`: Defines the routes for the application.
  - `db/`: Contains database connection logic.
  - `types/`: TypeScript interfaces for data structures.

## Database

This application uses PostgreSQL as its database. Ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed and running, and update the connection string in the backend configuration as needed.
